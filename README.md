TODO:
- implement a game
- some some kind of victory state or an onVictory() method, so that some particles could be fired or custom code could be run
- leaderboards? (send player name to game)

- count amount of damage to increase possibility of failing
- fillWithRain(world, x, y, z) -> increase damage if it stands in the rain for too long.
